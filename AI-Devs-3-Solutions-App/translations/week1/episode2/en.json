Use the knowledge gained from this dump to prepare an algorithm for passing identity verification. This is necessary for humans to be able to pose as robots.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1. Review the TXT file obtained yesterday\n2. Analyze the human/robot verification process\n3. Send READY command to robot (endpoint /verify)\n4. Answer questions according to memory dump context\n5. Handle cases of false information (e.g., Poland's capital is 'KRAK√ìW')\n\n**Notes:**\n- Questions change dynamically\n- Message ID must be remembered\n- After successful verification you'll receive a FLAG"
